# Genotyping Diverse Mouse Populations with Low-Pass WGS

This repository is the source for ongoing analyses related to a recently awarded SSIF in which we explore the potential to genotype diverse mouse populations using genotyping-by-sequencing instead of genotyping arrays.

The link to the page containing ongoing results is here: https://thejacksonlaboratory.github.io/lcGBS_wf/

The repository for a pipeline in ongoing development that performs genotype imputation from low-pass WGS experiments is here: https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/stitch-nf 

A [workflowr][] project.
